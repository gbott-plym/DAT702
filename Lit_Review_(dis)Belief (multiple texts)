Of late, I have been thinking about the mechanisms that come into play when we observe a spectacle – how we are able to give ourselves over to immersive experiences, how our subjectivity can be extended, enraptured... eloped even. More than this, we are able to disassociate from normative or hegemonic, largely societally-imposed (encouraged, indoctrinated), antecedental concepts for living, nee reality. 

Samuel Coleridge, in order to determine how successful examples of poetry are able to capture the imagination of the reader, hypothesised that a gifted writer can, with accents or kernels of truth, render even the supernatural as having  “semblance of truth” and enable too great sympathy. 

> [S]o as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith. 

We are, he proposes, in such instances at the cusp of poetic faith – of a faith in the genuine sensibilities of a piece, poem, prose or otherwise, and of that of the author’s subjectivity. We might be able to distinguish certain qualitative aspects as decidedly more false than others, yet – and here there are strong links to Aristotle – “in order to obtain adequate notions of any truth, we must intellectually separate its distinguishable parts; [… b]ut having so done, we must then restore them in our conceptions to the unity, in which they actually co-exist;” 

The ‘unity’ cannot occupy both representative forms – false and true – both incorporate one another in the soup of belief, which relies on the imagination and other human faculties of intellect and emotion to suspend the reader – a given audience – in a state of disbelief. 

Aristotle, in *The Poetics of Aritotle* (2008), asserts a similar position, written some 2000 years prior to Coleridge’s *Biographia Literaria*: 

> The secret of it lies in a fallacy, For, assuming that if one thing is or becomes, a second is or becomes, men imagine that, if the second is, the first likewise is or becomes. But this is a false inference. Hence, where the first thing is untrue, it is quite unnecessary, provided the second be true, to add that the first is or has become. For the mind, knowing the second to be true, falsely infers the truth of the first. 

It would seem here that there is an assumptive willingness, on the part of the spectator, to be carried away on the truth of the spectacle. This is true even of the “irrational,” which, once it has been introduced, with “an air of likelihood imparted to it, we must accept it in spite of the absurdity.” 

> In general, the impossible must be justified by reference to artistic requirements, or to the higher reality, or to received opinion. With respect to the requirements of art, a probable impossibility is to be preferred to a thing improbable and yet possible. 

This quote immediately reminded me of the works of Garcia-Marquez and other magical realists; even Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia (1999), where at the end of the film, the town – which is the melting pot of various, interweaving character narratives – is rained down upon by a great torrent of frogs. The latter “probable impossibility” creates a sense of marvel, not absurdity; so mired are we in the complicated nexus of our life, which does not solely encapsulate our own lived experiences, but those of everyone we know too, we lose sight of the world itself, of reality itself, a remarkable, transcendent gift. Coleridge sees mentions the following in relation to the effects of poetry: 

> […] by awakening the mind’s attention from the lethargy of custom, and directing it to the loveliness and the wonders of the world before us; an inexhaustible treasure, but for which in consequence of the film of familiarity by awakening the mind’s attention from the lethargy of custom, and directing it to the loveliness and the wonders of the world before us; an inexhaustible treasure, but for which in consequence of the film of familiarity 

Likewise, Aristotle opines that in order to “justify the rational” we must situate the irrational in conjunction with, or alongside, or as an “appeal to” reason. 

>'Yes,' we say, 'but the impossible is the higher thing; for the ideal type must surpass the reality.' To justify the irrational, we appeal to what is commonly said to be. In addition to which, we urge that the irrational sometimes does not violate reason; just as 'it is probable that a thing may happen contrary to probability.' 

A thing that may happen contrary to probability, specifically the phenomenon of “bleed” - where the boundary between player and character is blurred – can occur when we are playing video games; particularly those with strong character arcs and even romantic player choices (Waern, 2011). 

> Such scenarios […] invoke so strong emotions in players that players cannot fully distance themselves from their characters. It is possible to distinguish between a bleed-in effect, when the player’s character and identity affects the role, and a bleed-out effect, when the player shares the emotions of the character. 

Waern writes at length about the relationships developed between players and their avatar in Dragon Age Origins (2009), a role-playing game where your options for dialogue, as well as the relationships you develop through this mechanic, dramatically alter your gameplay experience and journey through the game. In particular, Waern looks at the ‘romantic’ . She writes about the “deeper emotions” players experience, concerning the romantic gameplay option that can be excised between a number of non-playable characters, though one in particular - the option to romance the character of Alistair – has an extended focus. The writer herself speaks of the way she, during her first play-through, sought to “[initiate] a romance but failed to develop it fully. I was deeply moved by, and dissatisfied with, the way Alistair broke off with me.” Her curiosity piqued, she took to appropriate forums and discovered that there were many such people with similar and even stronger feelings. Later, Waern cites Eladhari and Lindley (2003) who “argue that, by and large, computer games fail to create deep immersion into the player character, and that a deeper representation of the role-played character would be necessary in order to achieve it.” 

Player projection is also discussed within this context also, or the idea that we, as players, can project qualities of self onto the avatars we play as, “[creating] projected characters that resemble [themselves].” 

Aside from those aofrementioned, there are a number of reasons which are hypothesised to engineer this *bleed-in* and *bleed-out* effect; with two interesting points noted towards the end of the study, which are then not explored in any great detail. Firstly, Waern uses the term “pixel crush” - as defined by the Urban Dictionary as being “physically attracted to [a] pixelaided [pixelated?] person, usually a video game character or avatar.” Secondly, she states the following: 

>The bleed effect seems, in this case, [… to offer] a relatively safe form of romance in situations where you are not prepared to engage in a real one. 

In another piece on avatars, I discussed at length the feelings we can harbour for [our] avatars (Burgess, et al. 2020) and how these can manifest as very strong feelings of emotional and even romantic attachment, which evidently supports both the notions of “bleed” and latterly that of the “pixel crush;” but the latter quote, which signposts virtual or NPC “romance,” opens up this idea of safety, a reality which micha cardenas is constantly referring to in her art practice and transhuman ideology. Human relationships can of course be complex, amorphous, shifting things; likewise, many humans are bigoted, narrow-minded and violent; but is there also an endemic rise in both loneliness and detachment from, or an unwillingness to engage with, intimate (which should incorporate most physical forms of socialisation right through to romantic and sexual) relationships occurring in technocratic societies across the globe? 

These thoughts led me further down the rabbit hole as to *why* these feelings arise – why do we suspend belief in this way? Why, or how, are we able to feel something for an entirely fictional, purely representational entity, such as Alistair in *Dragon Age Origins*? Is there some psychological profile behind it, or a disorder of sorts? A trail of emotionally traumatic breadcrumbs to be found in every real-life player who has fallen for a virtual other? 

Researching in this vein, I found a paper (Wolfendale, 2007) that seems to have originated (at least in part) in response to a virtual rape case (LambdaMOO), which, for the author, was a call to evaluate the idea of *virtual harm* more thoroughly. Wolfendale asserts that we “cannot dismiss avatar attachment as morally insignificant” solely because the parameters of certain experiences with avatars are finite and dynamic (customisable). Likewise, the relationships, societies, cultures, ecologies we immerse ourselves in or develop online are, much like society itself, accountable to similar ethical standards. 

> moral relations are taken very seriously within virtual worlds. 

There is a really fascinating idea within this text that, irrespective of what certain theorists have written on the subject – that a user should not *invest too much* in their relationship to an avatar, or that users should acknowledge the “deviant” machinations of other players in a morality-free (virtual) context - the emotional reactions of both “players and programmers’ responses to inappropriate avatar violence” - and I would add to that moderators - would suggest that there is something beyond merely ‘bleed’ (Waern) at play here. To have ones avatar, or that of a fellow-player and friend or community member killed, violated, subjugated... has elicited some extremely strong emotional and psychological responses from users. As a phenomenon, this underpins the idea that the self, as a manifest construct of identity, is a reaching, plastic quantity; fluid, even; a thing that can fill a hollow body providing that body can function as a vessel for extending modalities of human experience. 

>The avatar is not just an object manipulated by the participant; it is a representation of identity. 

Furthermore: 

>Virtual communities are exciting and liberating precisely because they give participants freedom to explore new ways of interacting with others and new ways of presenting oneself. 

In *On Fairy Stories*, Tolkein presents this wonderful idea of the “sub-creator” - of the reality created by the storyteller themselves, in either the act of writing with just enough detail to allow the imagination to take a foothold or, through the art of telling a story so well that we give ourselves over to its reality, its momentary truth. 

What really happens is that the story-maker proves a successful “sub-creator.” He makes a Secondary World which your mind can enter. Inside it, what he relates is “true”: it accords with the laws of that world. You therefore believe it, while you are, as it were, inside. The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather art, has failed. You are then out in the Primary World again, looking at the little abortive Secondary World from outside. If you are obliged, by kindliness or circumstance, to stay, then disbelief must be suspended (or stifled), otherwise listening and looking would become intolerable. But this suspension of disbelief is a substitute for the genuine thing, a subterfuge we use when condescending to games or make-believe, or when trying (more or less willingly) to find what virtue we can in the work of an art that has for us failed. 

It is clear for Wolfendale that, the sub-creator – in this instance the game or virtual world – can be so powerful a sub-creator that its effects exist outside, or possibly in between, the Primary and Secondary worlds. This is no doubt due to the “quasi-physical” make up of any virtual-spatial environment, but also due to its paradigmatic links to Primary world sociality, rules and ethics. If anything, it is a stronger medium for sub-creating, reinforced by its vast network of online users, real sense of community and likely spill into other virtual settings or mediums, such as social media (texts, chat groups, forums etc). In a sense, and certainly nowadays, due to the ubiquity of technology and the internet, you might *never* conceivably detach yourself from the sub-creator fully, if you didn’t want to. 

> Avatars are therefore far more than mere online objects manipulated by a user. They are the embodied conception of the participant’s self through which she communicates with others in the community. 

Another fascinating aspect of this paper concerns attachment - "Is avatar attachment analogous to other forms of attachment – attachment to objects, people, groups, ideas?” We, as humans, Wolfendale states, “become attached to possessions not just because of their usefulness or aesthetic value but because they can represent aspects of ourselves and have important personal significance.” Similarly, “we often define who we are partly through our relationships with others, as parents, children, siblings, friends and lovers.” This is absolutely true, but there is often an assumption that with virtual affects, these are of less value, possibly because of the ability to create copies quite so easily, and thus limitless clones of an original. But an avatar is never a copy. We might, in a game, start with a mannequin, but then this base mesh is infinitely and subtly engineered to project conceptions of self, experimental ideations of self, but also classes, species, abilities, sexes... Whatever we choose in the end, these decisions are not arbitrary or random, we are always conveying *something* of ourselves, even if this outcome is random or arbitrary – which itself could link to some esoteric aspect of our personality, or mood on that given day.  

This is likely compounded by the ‘real’ effects of online community and the objectives of that community within the virtuality and context of a virtual world. Maintaining friendships, achieving something as a team, helping or assisting one another in a time of need, realising tangible results for time invested (one virtual society built a church) - these activities, taken away from a virtual context, are meaningful, healthy, fraternal ways to invest in people and create shared value. If we feel a sense of pride and togetherness at having accomplished some thing, a feeling which is shared by several or many others, are we supposed to catalogue that positive experience as hollow or less “morally significant” because that experience is contained in a *new* format or medium for human experience? 

>An avatar is far more than an imaginary object; it is a form of self-expression and online identity. Unlike attachment to an external imaginary object, therefore, attachment to an avatar is attachment to a self-chosen and self-created object; an object that you control, that you act through and that you use to interact with others. It is the object that represents you in the virtual world and it is therefore not imaginary at all, or not in the way that an imaginary friend or fictional character is imaginary.... Furthermore, avatar attachment occurs in the context of a community of participants – a whole virtual world – who have shared expectations about the use of avatars and who all use avatars to communicate with each other. 

Avatars are self-created objects whether we manipulate their initial exterior forms or not, as they are the prosthesis with which we interact with a virtual reality – they follow our every directive. There is a feedback loop here too, in that the operability of the avatar reveals to us the laws and structure of a given world. It is only through our close observations of an avatar, a relationship of mastery that develops through close contact and conjoined mimesis, that we can begin to understand the [for example] physics of a virtual space. But there is more to it than merely mimesis, for all the reasons aforementioned. 

Avatars are containers of the self. We can fill them with what we are, as conception or performance, and this can be projected into a virtual world. 

Avatars are extensions of our identities that we can feel attached to, much like personal belongings.  

Avatars can situate us within virtual communities that are rewarding and life-affirming. 

Non-playable avatars can elicit a spectrum of strong emotional responses for players/player avatars. 

This discussion is creating a new line of enquiry for me. When we engage with certain media formats, there is commonly associated with immersive experiences this idea of ‘escapism’, but I’m beginning to wonder if this is an appropriate term. When enraptured in these moments of sub-creation – through playing a game, reading a book, watching a film etc – are we escaping, or are we seeking to broaden the scope of our experience? Hart (2017) posits this notion of “experimentation” - of the player wanting to feel something new, be someone new, experience a new environment or space and time. It could of course be both (escapism and experimentation), but new technologies are blurring the boundaries between our subjectivity and perception. One could have an argument with your best friend in a purely virtual medium, both delete the thread of messages, have forgotten what the argument was about in a week and still require a period of separation to cool down before meeting again. Informatically, that tete-a-tete would still exist *somewhere*, but the residual effect of that argument, as a damaging or difficult exchange, would linger physically too. We are entangled with the virtual now. It is boundaryless. 

Two films keep springing to mind as a point for further discussion.  

The 2013 Spike Jonze film *Her* is about a man who, after a divorce, begins to form an attachment with and later develops a more intimate relationship with an AI – an operating system that gradually learns to respond more fully and with more synchronicity to its (perceived) primary user. I am reading Greg Egan’s 1994 novel *Permuation City* and found myself scribbling a note in the page break space at the end of a chapter, as an attempt to subdivide the idea of [seemingly] cogent virtual identities, in relation to the possible simulated forms that could define such an entity. Reasonably, there are three that I can posit, though the first two forms are linked under the nomenclature ‘AI’: 1) Conscious AI identity, 2) Programmed AI identity, 3) Avatar (user controlled). I could have added a fourth category of Avatar (non-user controlled) too, but this would – to my mind at least – fall too close to the second category of virtual identity. To clarify, or elaborate, the conscious AI identity is conscious in the sense that it is a hyperreal representation of singular human consciousness, indistinguishable from its real world Other. A programmed AI identity is therefore an AI that has been programmed to consciouslessly function as such, or dialectically, an identity that has evolved from errant code to full consciousness within a virtual binary system. Either way, it is code that bears the hallmark of consciousness within a computational framework that need not be representationally humanistic. Latterly, an Avatar – a hollow body prosthesis that enables a real-world user to exist within and interact with a virtual world – is dynamically conscious when utilised, not at all when disused. Returning to Her, and bringing to mind again that maxim of Aristotle’s, concerning the plausibility of an irrational condition if it is weighted against something more tautological, or platitudinous, How likely is it that we can fall in love with an AI? A program? We *know* that we can fall in love, that this possible - a reality even. Likewise, programs are designed to be very responsive and accurate, and as technology advances, it is feasible that they could become that much more persuasive and considerate. 

I will also add that I have tangentially been thinking (reminiscing) about Microsoft’s virtual assistant, *Clippit*, that used to pop up when you activated most Office apps. Otherwise known as *Clippy*, this avatar was an AI that would offer tips on formatting, word processing and every other form of diagnostic help, the majority of which was prompted, but clearly some of it was context sensitive, for Clippy could comment on your work *depending on what you were writing.* I remember finding this feature of Windows 96 irritating as a non-PC literate child; there was, by all accounts, a huge backlash against the inclusion of Clippy in wider society too. Clippy was a distraction, a menace, a voyeur... Yet it was part of the experience of using MS in that time, intractably so. But I wonder if, once removed, anyone mourned the loss of Clippy? Clearly ‘he’ was intended to be – and has now morphed into a faceless – office assistant, but why give him a character, a personality, in the first place? Why give him form outside prompts, tips and advice in a UI? It can be a very isolating experience, working at a PC, particularly when work is the form that that activity takes. 

The second film is Lars Gillespie’s *Lars and the Real Girl* [LatRG] (2007). Lars is said to suffer from schizoid personality disorder; he lost his mother as she was giving birth to him and as an adult, reacts badly to the news that his sister is pregnant. For manifold reasons, Lars begins to act out, fearing an existential threat to his peaceful if strained family and no doubt self. To problematise these feelings, Lars purchases a sex doll (RealDoll) which he names Bianca, whom he introduces to his family as his new partner. After visiting a psychiatrist, Lars’ family are advised to go along with this delusion and support Lars while he processes the issues he is trying to come to terms with, namely those of intimacy, trust, openness, closeness, loss, repressed grief, things which were evidently lacking in his psychological and emotional development as a human being, growing up with an emotionally illiterate father and no mother figure. For Lars, Bianca is a conduit to his coming to terms with his sister’s pregnancy, which he inextricably considers a mortally dangerous situation, after what happened to his mother. Eventually - and after breaking up with Biance - Lars comes to terms with the loss of his mother and finds solace in the support of his family and community (who, on the advice of his family, entertain Lars and Bianca as best they can), things he has always been distant or detached from previous. 

But here, in this example, there is no *suspension of disbelief* on the part of the players. It is somewhat meta in that sense; if anything, the unreality of their circumstances, nimble reactions, whispered conversations help to more acutely render our empathy and belief in Lars and his struggle; the empathic willfulness of the town to play along in any exchanges with Lars creates a meta-performative empathy, a distance which we bridge as viewers, which only serves to further embellish our investment in Lars’ state of mind. Just like Lars, those users who feel that they are themselves instantiated in their avatars, as well as those who can fall in love with NPCs and programs, it is bleed and belief in the reality of those virtual entities, however removed from ‘real’, physical ‘life’, which bridges that distance. It is because of the sub-creator, the reality of the story told so convincingly, the truth that can definitively be found in the representational, the marriage of truth and fantasy (the irrational). 

To summarise, in light of LatRG and its presentation of Bianca not as a living thing to we, its audience, *but as a living thing to Lars*, a new line of enquiry has formed. Are the close attachments we experience to our virtual entities – our sophisticated learning programs, our charismatic NPCs, our projected or extended virtual selves – the result of the possible realities outlined throughout this essay thus far (and latterly the piece on Avatars), or otherwise, is some psychological condition or phenomenon at play? 

A study published by Keefer et al (2014) seeks to extend the concept of *subjectivity uncertainty*, which at the outset of the paper is linked to the ‘objectivation of strangers’ – which is by all accounts is a fairly typical psychological phenomenon. The goal of this study is to examine whether or not it is possible for subjectivity uncertainty to occur in other relationship settings, such as between romantic partners. Subjectivity uncertainty, for clarity, is defined thusly: 

>subjectivity uncertainty—uncertainty about one’s ability to know and appropriately respond to that target’s subjective states. To manage this uncertainty, people downplay the target’s subjective attributes and focus instead on attributes perceived as easier to understand and control. 

This, it is noted, is most common when a “partner is seen as insensitive, elusive, or otherwise unpredictable." This uncertainty can, it is argued, have far-reaching and at times damaging effects where one or both partners are concerned, ad particularly where ‘interpersonal objectification’ is a reality (whether knowingly or not). This can also lead to \ “subtle and pervasive” expression of objectification known as ‘infrahumanisation’, where we “[view] others as lacking the subjective experience of self-relevant emotions and other characteristically human states.” A very dehumanising idea; I wonder whether it has links to any narcissistic personality disorders? The flipside of this is even more manifestly damaging, in that “feeling objectified by others can increase self-objectification—a chronic state of self-evaluation shown to have many harmful effects on physical and mental well-being." The (perceived) act of objectification creates a lens for self-objectification – though can such feelings be manifested in particular persons predisposed to such modes of self-critical thought? 

Objectification is a natural phenomenon; as stated earlier, it is not uncommon. People who have experienced damaging relationships may be more susceptible to both the effects of objectification and the act of objectifiying. Infrahuminsation is more problematic as people may choose to assert “feelings of personal power” because “empowered people feel free to pursue their personal goals, even at the risk of treating others as less than fully human.” 

Ironically, “focusing... on a target’s complex and dynamic mental life should make it difficult to disregard that person’s mental states, [however] this focus can trigger compensatory simplification of those states.” The more complex an individual’s apparent psychological profile, the more the objectification occurs. 

>It also complements the claim that power increases objectification by explaining how objectification can compensate for a lack of power—that is, for felt uncertainty about one’s ability to interact with another person at a subjective level. 

Within this study’s results, it cites that with careful interventions and increased social confidence and exposure, subjectivity uncertainty can decrease. Where the latter is not proactively practiced, “these findings suggest that people who are uncertain about close others’ subjectivity may be sacrificing meaningful, intimate connection for short-term certainty.” 

Firstly, it would, as a result of reading this paper, be interesting to further research as to why and how we objectify people in the first place. 

Secondly, I do wonder if there is something in this idea of subjectivity uncertainty and the forms of behaviour that can manifest as a result, in a range of relationship settings. Would a lack of socialisation – primarily healthy or ‘typical’ social interactions – damage our confidence in such settings? The answer would seem to be a resounding yes. Outside implications on confidence, can this damage manifest as other pervasive and “subtle” psychological conditions? Again, yes, it would seem so. I wonder if in the act of name calling we objectify, because it is reductive. “Pig,” “Ugly,” “Tramp,” “Idiot,” “Fat,” etc – these reduce the entirety of a person’s complexity to a single signifier, which itself can be arbitrary, irrational, erroneous. In so doing, we immediately draw from a pool of associations derived from our cultural consciousness – the structure of meaning we can draw upon through semiotics of language and our culture, which is hegemonic. If the act of objectification can lead to increased self-objectification, a withdrawal from either an ongoing relationship or any *possible* relationship is conceivable and directly correlated with this study. Likewise, those feelings of self-worth and empowerment are hugely impacted. Virtual relationships, or even the benign promise of an NPC romance, would seem much more agreeable, even preferable, where there is that subjectivity uncertainty. Complete control, complete detachment or attachment, freedom to experiment with other similar relationship states... No consequences, other than those defined within the boundaries set by the *real* participant... 

Though does this “freedom” represent a lack of investment (Wolfendale, 2007) in a virtual other, or is it just a new expression for attachment? Is belief a factor in this?

# Margolies, E. (2016) *Props* 

## The Object in Actor Training and Rehearsal 

 

In the above chapter, Margolies seeks to overview the various methods for how props are used or could be used by actors on stage. Props here, much like in their wiki definition, are defined as needing to produce a “predictable” emotion in the actor using them. Though there is a distinction present here, where the divergent methodologies for acting can utilise imagined, real or ‘trigger’ objects, where the latter “reliably – mechanically […] – produce a response.” 

Trigger objects are said to enable greater focus of concentration. Where, for example, the actor is instructed to use a simple stick to represent a sword, there is a world of information that must be conveyed upon brandishing that stick – the actor must simulate the correct physical properties of observing and then interacting with a sword and not a stick. Referring back to Stanislavski’s work with props, which primarily focuses on their use as collections of sensory impressions that an actor can work with, ergo the prop is absent, or where the actor is reminded to study their engagement with a prop, so that none of its physical importance is rendered as arbitrary or habitual, where the prop is present. Here, it is stated, “real objects provide dangerous shortcuts for the imagination”. Though within the methodology of the trigger object: 

>Paradoxically, […] the concrete object disappears, even as it is given increasing significance. [...The] real object, which might, in its full recalcitrant presence, be a less reliable trigger of the required emotion than an actor would wish, is replaced by a simulacrum.< 

An example used to explore this point involve an ashtray, that should be demonstrably apropos within the context of a scene or dramatic exercise. It might be referred to (as a verbal or scenic signifier) as being made of crystal and belonging to a wealthy house, with the actor simulating the weight of such a material quality, when ‘in reality’ it may just be cut glass. The signs of the real creating the hyperreal. A cheap, mass-produced plastic ashtray would therefore function as an inadequate prop, not even worthy of the status of simulacrum within the aforementioned context. Likewise, the removal of a prop object, as alluded to earlier, can have a similar effect. 

>Because an imaginary object has to be constructed, an actor may invest more energy in this work, and pay more attention to material qualities than when handling an apparently familiar object.< 

A critique of the latter method might – where an object is, for the audience, rendered as invisible or imagined – change the context of a scene or play. A violinist, who mimes the actions of playing a violin that is not physically apparent, could appear mad, dreaming, lost, romantic etc, but to no one would (or arguably very few) would he appear to be *actually playing a violin* in part due to our critical consciousness. 

>An audience picks up a great deal of visual information about physical properties, and […] if these perceptions do not rise to consciousness, they either contribute to a successful image or to a nagging sense that something ‘doesn’t ring true’.< 

That being said, were the actor a trained violinist, so accustomed to the materiality of their violin, so attuned with its positional chords and strains, could they not indubitably play without playing? In addition, a prop bow or chinrest would surely embody in some qualitative sense that perceived lack of materiality, of the substantial? The fragmented signifiers of a thing can surely, as indexically attached, evolve to represent the whole that they are distinct from, no?

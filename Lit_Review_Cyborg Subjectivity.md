>Why should our bodies end at the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin? (Harraway)< 

In Hayles text, information or informatics can, it is posited, achieve corporeality within an embodied or given virtual space – where data is said to be in “tension” with pattern and presence. This idea has festered since my first reading; as such, I want to return to this idea of “computerised subjectivity” - where our relationship with technology can blur the body/mind dualism of subjectivity and the latter is, as a result, ‘extended’.  This idea of extension is referenced across several texts that I have read now (above), and elsewhere these extensions are conflated with embodiment – of the “permeable” (Harraway) space that exists between technology and mind, wherein: 

>Late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert.< 

Another way that Harraway elucidates the qualities of the cyborg, of the coalescence of machine and man, is by attempting to determine their unified Otherness; variously, machines are described as being made of “sunshine” 

>[T]hey are all light and clean because they are nothing but signals, electromagnetic waves, a section of a spectrum, and these machines are eminently portable, mobile< 

Whereas man, in any pre-Cyborg coexistence at least, “are nowhere near so fluid, being both material and opaque”.  Cyborgs are, in comparison “ether, quintessence.” This could be argued as a somewhat disingenuous reading of the biology of man, whose behaviours and proclivities may not present as “ether, quintessence” though fundamentally, biotically, the “ether” that governs a machine, the mathematics and physics of man are, it could be argued, not dissimilar at base. McLuhan’s idea that the central nervous system is searching for means of extension and equivalency, compatibility, would support this premise. Is man’s persistent integration with coded systems and digital paradigms a search for pattern as a rejection of randomness (Hayles)? Likewise, clumsy, meaty things that we are, are we too [as human beings] not just incredibly crude, curiously organic information receivers? 

>[W]e are living through a movement from an organic, industrial society to a polymorphous, information system< 

Representation, or the information we receive about an object, is positioned as an *Organic of Domination* (OoD) with its counterpart, “simulation” an *Informatic of Domination* (IoD). The latter – Iod – “cannot be coded as ‘natural’, a realization that subverts naturalistic coding for the [OoD]” There are strong links to Baudrillard here too; not just because of what the simulation entails, but because of what can engender one. “The signs of the real replacing the real – the Hyperreal.” Any representative form cannot be considered natural, because the information we derive from it is interpreted by codified mind-body sensors, incapable of interpreting raw data as raw data. Though is that more or less possible as a cyborg? I’m reminded of Paul, the Muad’Dib, in Dune, whose mentat and Bene Gesserit training enables him to detach the emotional mind from the reaching, data-driven mind. 

>Human beings, like any other component or subsystem, must be localized in a system architecture whose basic modes of operation are probabilistic, statistical. No objects, spaces, or bodies are sacred in themselves; any component can be interfaced with any other if the proper standard, the proper code, can be constructed for processing signals in a common language.< 

Is this the great trick of the techno-giants – to have enforced technology on us to such an extent that we find ourselves less impotent when we are using it, than when not? The “common language” of online media and connectivity, as well as social media – arguably the truest/worst “interfacing.” Returning to another of Hayles’ analogies, where Junk (Burroughs) is suggested to be the “ideal” product, as the onus is on selling the consumer to the product, not the other way round. 

>When bodies are constituted as information, they can not only be sold but fundamentally reconstituted in response to market pressures (Hayles)< 

Here, and in relation to Harraway, the Cyborg Subjectivity – the extended subjectivity – is, through technology, able to process *more* information so long as it is in a “common language.” The body here could be read as any component – any software or hardware – that is readily accessible by way of interfacing. Yet we are tied to these things, our devices, our tech, which updates itself relentlessly, outmodes itself seamlessly, until its integration is unseen. For we are updated too. Symbiosis. 

>The home, workplace, market, public arena, the body itself—all can be dispersed and interfaced in nearly infinite, polymorphous ways< 

>The cyborg is a kind of disassembled and reassembled, postmodern collective and personal self. […] Communications technologies and biotechnologies are the crucial tools recrafting our bodies.< 

Disassembly and reassembly does not infer ‘unmade’; the cyborg is not broken by the relentless adaptability and limitless utility of extension as man-tech, but repurposed, retextured, reimaged. 

>The boundary is permeable between tool and myth, instrument and concept, historical systems of social relations and historical anatomies of possible bodies, including objects of knowledge. Indeed, myth and tool mutually constitute each other. […] One consequence is that our sense of connection to our tools is heightened.< 

There are various “bodies” listed here, but “objects of knowledge” is exciting. A tool, an interface, can create experiences or circumstances where knowledge is gained. This is transactional – without the tool, without its conception, an object of knowledge is trapped in a vacuum around the invisible monolith; invisible as in unseen, ephemeral, the ghost. 

>We cannot go back ideologically or materially. […] [We seek] escalating dominations of abstract individuation, an ultimate self—untied at last from all dependency, a man in space.< 

Space here could conveniently mean the boundless – of a life and its perception of its own existence framed as borderless and expanding. Where man is capable, through “machine” interfaces that are truly immersive, seamlessly interchangeable and micro-controllable, of anything – of the erosion of the real and of the imagined. Here, Baudrillard's *Hyperreal*, it could be argued, loses some of its awe-inspiring prescience. The “man in space” does not choose the hyperreal or the simulation over the real-world, the two are mutually exclusive, co-dependent. Notwithstanding the opportunities for mass micro sharing of data in what would likely be a networked utopia. 

>Intense pleasure in skill, machine skill, ceases to be a sin, but an aspect of embodiment. The machine is not an *it* to be animated, worshipped, and dominated. The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible for machines; they do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for boundaries; we are they.<

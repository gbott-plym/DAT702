##Hart, C (2017) Getting Into the Game: An Examination of Player Personality Projection in Videogame Avatars. [Online] http://gamestudies.org/1702/articles/hart Vol. 17, issue 2 [Accessed 21.11.2021] 

 

In order to identify whether or not video game players invest aspects of their actualised or ideal selves when exploring a virtual space as an avatar, Hart had over 50 participants play Skyrim for three hours after first creating a character. Players used the game’s avatar creation tool (a feature that has become standardised across many RPGs) to develop a playable character, before utilising that character in the game – which is a non-linear, open-world fantasy game. Using Goldman’s *Five Factor Personality Inventory* to identify and position actual and ideal indicators, Hart developed three research questions, which evaluated data against 1) the players’ personalities, 2) how they create and use their avatars, and 3) whether the two aforementioned data sets show any correlation. 

This study is by all accounts not that original; it signposts various similar tests that have been run by other researchers and institutions, but presumably this one is notable for its use of the above-named personality inventory to decode and compare its data sets. 

Initially, Hart seeks to define what an avatar is, whilst acknowledging that the use of an avatar in a game is dynamic. This is variously referred to as means of projecting notions of the self into a virtual space as an avatar, but more reductively as a means of simply interacting with a game environment. 

>Avatars are not just digital dolls for the player to interact with in electronic space, but rather cultivated projections of the user. 

He quotes Banks (2017) concept of “multispatiality”, which concerns the idea that “players can in someway exist, or project aspects of their physical self or character, into the digital environment is referred to as multispatiality.” 

The results of the study are notable for two reasons. Firstly, ‘openness to experience,’ as a proactive personality trait, was the most consistently observed, *projected* attribute in the first data set. 
>Perhaps in videogames, this personality trait lends itself particularly well to projection because the game environment may be perceived as either a space where self-actualization or exploration can be experienced to a great degree, or where such things are impossible due to the limited nature of the medium. 

In could be considered highly ironic that gamers consider themselves ‘open to experience,’ or more likely points to the changing reality of experience, whose modalities are in flux between real and virtual positions in contemporary life. 
Secondly, Hart was expecting more correlation between the first and second research questions data sets, where the avatar reified notions of the ideal self in a virtual context, but there was little correlation between most factors. This led Hart to posit the following: 
 
>While variable levels of correlation were expected across the five dimensions of personality, I expected more than one of the dimensions to show significant correlation. Finding no such correlations does not contradict previous research, but rather suggests that instead of using avatars as vehicles for projecting their personality into digital space, players use avatars as a means by which to explore alternative versions of themselves or even anti-projections of their personalities. […] This supports and illustrates the idea that players do not have a uniform strategy or desire to project their personalities into the avatars they create to interact with the digital world. 

Gamers are inclined to project an alternative self-view, or an anti-self-view, as opposed to that of an idealised self or normative self. Extending the self into the public sphere of games could entail a degree of risk, as our identity is a container of personal (private), political and social information. It is much easier to experience hardship, rejection or failure as a pseudonymous or even anonymous self, that may fluidly incorporate some real, ironic real or anti-real traits, but as an anti-self? A polarised self? 
 
>This lends support to the argument players use digital spaces as realms for experimentation rather than pure projection. 

Experimentation is a key idea here, as it is distinct (remote even) from escapism or projection, as experimentation is not randomised. It is thoughtful; it uses the same set of keys but for different doors. The tangible self is still there, but it is playfully inverted, in relation to conceptual ideals that belong to the game possibly, or even that it is reactive to data sets that are at once more arbitrary that those of any personality test, but also far more distinctive, because they could be strategic, topical, prescient. More data should have been gathered and discussed in relation to choices pertaining to character classes, races, genders (etc) and ability metrics than is yielded here. These would represent “cultivated projections”.

This therapy involved people suffering with schizophrenia spectrum or affective disorder engaging with an ‘AVATAR’ that was voiced by a therapist. There were two control groups, one that engaged with supportive therapies, such as counselling, and the AVATAR group. The AVATAR therapists also occupied a more typical clincial role alongside their role as AVATAR. The auditory hallucinations associated with above conditions are typically “derogatory” and “threatening” in nature; the AVATAR intervention was intended to empower the participants and reduce the controlling, malevolent “omnipotence” of the voices – or certain voices. Participants in the AVATAR trial were asked “[N]ot  to  pre-specify  the  number  of  voices,  but instead […] select the voice that they most wished to influence.” 

Likewise, “Participants first created a computerised representation of the entity that they believed was the source of their main voice. After completing the set-up of the avatar in an introductory session, which included a comprehensive assessment of the voice(s) and included verbatim content.” There is no companion imagery provided as part of the study, but the aforementioned quote posits the likelihood of the avatar as having certain physical, computerised attributes. The following sessions involved initial, short, face-to-face meetings with their AVATAR, with their therapist “sat in a second room with a control panel that allowed them to speak in his or her own voice, or as the avatar.” The pitch of these interventions was modulated in relation to live webcam feeds that both displayed and recorded the patients. There were two phases of the sessions: at the outset, the participants were encouraged to progressively challenge their AVATAR directly, “assertively,”while in the second phase, the AVATAR “conceded ground and acknowledged the strengths and good qualities of the participant.” 

>There is an explicit focus on self-esteem and acknowledgments of the participant’s strengths and capabilities. 

The results of this study show roundly positive results while the trial was live (participants saw a 33% total improvement on the Psychotic Symptoms Ratings Scale). In both groups – supportive counselling and AVATAR – the participants followed a trend of improvement that was markedly quicker in the latter group, though during follow-up sessions, post-trial, the AVATAR sessions were less impactful. A reason for this is posited as being the short duration of the sessions, the format for which could be adapted to the needs of the patient, i.e. longer, more intensive sessions where required. 

What is telling about this treatment is an idea which Atkins highlights, where he refers to his avatar – to all intents and purposes a container of his esoteric self – as ‘hollow’, “dead” representations that are “generated from emptiness”. There is quintessentially nothing *empty* about the avatars used within this experimental therapy, which like Atkin’s characters, reify personalised concepts of self, self as other or alien, but also of self-worth *as virtual entities*. These entities – in both instances – are of course puppets in some sense, vehicles for embodying some secondary purpose or affectation (art practice, clinical intervention), but again, where Atkins says that when we look at an artist’s corpus – the holism of their work – we find not that we can learn much about the world, but we certainly can learn a lot about the artist and their worldview. This is so true of this therapy also – it holds a mirror up to the trial participants and resituates their sense of self as worthy, as empowered, the virtual a conduit here for giving form to an idealised, possible real. A very Stelarc idea that – the inverse crossing of that boundary, so typically rendered as real-controls-virtual. Stelarc is excited by this notion of the “intelligent avatar” which through some, potentially various interfaces, “might be able to perform in the real world by possessing a physical body.” 

The only caveat here is that Stelarc is talking about the physical (actual) body being manipulated as the puppet of an AI or persistent system, but in that conversation between AVATAR and participant, whose self is oppressed by a hallucinatory, omnipresent other, there must be such relief, such catharsis, such power in challenging that embodied manifestation of their worst hallucinations. Here, the AVATAR becomes an emancipatory agent – it helps embody a freer, less tortured actual body and mind.

This essay comprises an analysis of the artist micha cardenas’ AR ‘game’ *Sin  Sol/No  Sun* in relation to mc’s *post-indentarian* aesthetics of the “transreal”. As a transgender woman of Latina heritage, cardenas’ work examines the "gendered  and  racialized  violence, environmental destruction, and colonial violence” that is directed towards both marginalised identities and the environment globally. The game, in this instance, provides a virtual ‘safe space’ to tell the player a story of environmental and social violence. Aura, “the  AI hologram of a trans Latina,” the game’s avatar, and her virtual dog, outline a desperate and tragic story of a dystopian future in a world scorched by climate change. As an AR game, it is advised that players explore this experience in an open, natured environment, which provides a stark point of contrast for certain in-game environments, which includes “archived” 3D scans of woodland and forest. 

> [T]he game’s  digital  landscapes  have  been  carved  out  of  3D  scans  from  present-day  local  forests.  In  this sense, our lived  present is virtually  designed  within  the  history  of devastation  that Aura  narrates in  the  game. 

The work, in conjunction with the article, raises some interesting perspectives in relation to the empowerment of "marginalised subjects” and their adoption of virtual spaces as a means to achieving , but also regarding embodiment. Through digital materialism, it is stated that, while having not “effaced” itself of “sexism, racism, or other forms of oppression” this branch of  materialsm has, as an ideology, created space to shine a light “on  the  interplay  between  nonhuman  and  human  actors  involved  in  media  production  and  consumption  dynamics.” This is key, as in the process, “a  myriad  of identities that would  exceed  the  traditional frames of representation” have been established as informatic realities. A deconstructed and codified self is possible within this framework. As a Latina transwoman, cardenas has experienced the violence and rejection of a heteronormative, patriarchal, deeply conservative, predominantly white culture that is unable to assimilate ideas of race and transgender within either of the latter constructs. As such, Casalini quotes Sandy Stone, who states that “the  transgender body  was “natural”  to  cyberspace  and  “unnatural”  to  the  physical world  due  to  the  social  projections  that  the  latter  subjected  it  to.” This is later defined as the establishment of a virtual ecology that was instantiated by, and mediated through, transgender perspectives, which is said to “[inform] the  idea  of multiplying  and  crossing  realities as an  embodied practice.  Gender  boundaries,  just  like  the  separation  between  “virtual”  and  “physical,”  are contested  and  blurred  within  a  transreal  perspective  that  makes  use  of  digital  interfaces  such  as videogames,  VR,  augmented  realities,  and  other  hacker  strategies  of technological disruption.” 	The article consistently draws on feminist theory, which if read through the lens of the likes of Judith Butler, posits that gender is a performative construct, though a trans reading of such a position must make for problematic reading. The idea of dysphoria relies on gender identity as being something that is established (and rejected) in early childhood, not something that is reactively constructed in relation to political or cultural diffusion. The reality of biological sex is, at the outset (early childhood), polarised by the identity they are encouraged/coerced to assume. Where these issues are pervasive in a societal context, the virtual provides a space “to contest, disrupt, and transform reality and matter.” cardenas’ art practice can therefore be considered an attempt to “collapse the  separation between virtual and  physical  through  spatial  and  temporal  crossings  that  give  way  to  alternative  and multiple  notions  of  time  and  space.” This is particularly true of *Sin Sol* but also one of her earlier, seminal works, *Becoming Dragon*, which involved the artist spending 365 hours wired into a VR game, during which time she embodied a dragon avatar and only engaged with the ‘actual world’ through projections within the headset. This piece was a reaction to the imposed ‘Real Life Experience’ (RLE) that is required of any transitioning person, where one must live as their gender identity (in the US) for one year ahead of any gender reassignment surgery. The performance itself actually took place while cardenas was fulflling this RLE year. In a review of the show posted on the Art Columnist site, Agáta Hošnová reflects on cardenas work in relation to its enmeshing of the virtual and actual ‘real’: 

> [W]e already enter other realities on [a] daily basis in our interaction with all the digital platforms we use - without even realising it, we dwell in the mixed reality, where virtual objects (such as all kinds of screens, face recognition systems and ubiquitous cameras) exist alongside physical ones, but this co-existence can be pushed further. 

Cardenas’ work is said to “deliberately [transgress] multiple realities... thanks to the technological environment of the digital and postmodern age” where this idea of trans, of movement between polarities, can (and does) embody multiple representational forms. 

Returning to the Casalini article, in summarising the use of *Sin Sol’s* avatar, the author then cites Uri McMillan’s work concerning pre-digital “embodied avatars” which are capable of “not  only  performing  through  their  physical  bodies  but  are  also  able  to  speculatively  traverse different  realities  in  disembodied  forms.” This quote is important, though I would counter that while it is impossible – with current technologies – to wholly inhabit a virtual other, or avatar, these representations can only be *so* disembodied when they are quite so aesthetically, politically, demonstrably exacting - Aura, the game’s avatar, is said to be an example of the “affective  interconnections “ that exist “between  players and  avatars.” Just as important is the idea of traversal – that through an interface, understood here to mean the multiplicity of “virtual objects” that can contain and extend our subjectivity, projections of self-ideation and -representation, we can experience different realities. A trans life is testament to this: it renders the above quote as a tautology; likewise the self, embodied virtually, as avatar, as informatic self, is better placed to disrupt the hegemonies of cyberspace and thus fully realise itself, finally, in a space that is “polytemporal” and open, dynamic. 

>The  virtual  is  the  space  of  emergence  of  the  new,  the  unthought,  the  unrealized,  which  at every  moment  loads  the  presence  of  the  present  with  supplementarity,  redoubling  a  world through  parallel universes, universes that might have  been. 

 

 

## Schulz, J. (1993) Virtu-Real Space: Information Technologies and the Politics of Consciousness. Leonardo, Vol. 26, Number 5, October 1993, pp. 437-444. [Online] 

 

>A significant shift is occurring in the make-up, physical nature and composition of space as it is experienced in contemporary culture. This shift, which is a direct result of the ubiquitous presence of information technologies in the cultural landscape, signals that physical components alone no longer comprise the infrastructure of the contemporary social environment. 

Technology is everywhere. It is omnipresent. It is a spectre. It is a thing capable of embodying the shifting reality of the post-identarian self in its every guise. It is “ubiquitous”. 

>[V]irtual space is everywhere we *are*. 

Schulz uses a variety of examples to explore this concept of virtu-real space, the first one being virtual credit/debt. He cites a VISA ad that was almost immediately pulled after it sought to position credit as being “everywhere you want to be” - which by extension implies that a red credit (im)balance is also everywhere you are; the looming prospect of bankruptcy or insolvency for some, or the many, clearly.  

This is also true of the many informatic datasets that tangentially spiral into a foundational data self in the virtual space. 

> Due to the ubiquity of virtual profiles […] *we* exist everywhere. Our virtual bodies populate the contemporary virtual landscape. […] But we do not simply exist in virtual space. We are also *constructed* in that space. 

Schulz uses the example of “information flows” which situate the technology user as being "constituted” by these feedback loops: a participatory experience, where user and circuit require one another to construct the flow. Virtual space is regarded as being objectively “placeless,” yet the notion of *cyberspace* complicates this assumption, as these spaces are “principal sites of identity construction in contemporary culture.” 

This, as a sentiment, is correlational with each of the above essays, where the virtual can be seen as empowered with notions, hard attributes – such as manifested physical qualities (speech, race, gender, etc) – and informatic representations of the self. In each case, the driver of these embodiments is the identity of the actual self, which Schulz infers is still, “to a certain extent, grounded in physicality.” 

>There still must be a physical body that shapes itself in real space before there can be a virtual body. As such, identity remains, to a certain extent, grounded in physicality. 

Those teens, as described by Turkle (2011), should object to the above quote on a critical level. Where malevolent code, fake accounts, automated spammers and AI trolls are a virtual (possible) reality for many social media users, and simulation as a construct of the posthuman is to be embraced (Harraway, 1991), this relationship we have developed with virtuality, can we be completely certain that our identity *is* in fact “grounded in physicality”? Even if the latter can all be traced back to some original matrix or flourish of binary which originated at the fingertips of an actual human being, how long ago was that, and for how long – and in how many iterations – has the code evolved, morphed, redacted itself? A chain of unending possibility, almost gossamer in its hyperreality. 

It is almost remarkable how prescient this short essay is, in so many ways. Schulz writes of a networked reality that, in the history of the Internet, was barely even be deemed to be in its infancy in 1993 and prior. Of virtual space, he states that “the distinction between surveillant and surveilled is unclear” and of a “predictive device that operates before actions are performed” both of which, in light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the various data dumps on the hacker site Wikileaks, as well as innovations in tech that have led to modern day SMART devices, such as the Echo and the Dot. The latter is linked to the habits, or informatic patterns, which can take many forms, but often most commonly consumerist affectations – though again, this would not have been possible in 1993, or at least not in the way we experience such interactions today. 

>Habits - those unconscious, private patterns of repeated actions – comprise not only the times when we are most vulnerable, but also those times that are most highly codified in virtual space. 

Schulz uses the example of purchasing maternity products for a friend, and afterwards (having provided a residential address at the time of purchase), receiving a brochure – as a single male homeowner – every year after. Despite not having turned on any of my device’s SMART features, I recently had a conversation with my partner about relearning guitar, and how I may do this after the conclusion of my MRES. Lo and behold, within a day or so, I began receiving targeted ads, though curiously, I had not committed to a single search or speculative online enquiry. My colleague, having purchased some guitar paraphernalia in the run up to Christmas two years ago for his nephew, has now begun noticing targeted ads for guitar-based products again. I just had to capitalise the word “christmas” in the last sentence as it was underscored as being an error – because of its connotations with Jesus Christ, or because it is every Western economy’s most heightened period of consumer spending? In short, the fingerprints of self, these kernels of identity, which manifest as ever-lengtheining chains of identity-code, are never in stasis, they only grow in complexity. Oure of technology feeds and is fed by the virtu-real self ad infinitum. 

>[It] is no longer possible to speak only of real (physical) space; nor is it the case that virtual space has colonized real space (the contemporary landscape is not, and never will be, total virtual reality). Rather, the two categories of virtual and real space have collapsed into one another, creating a  virtu-real space that on the surface seems like real space but is significantly different from it, especially in terms of the social relations that it produces. 

The piece ends with, if not a warning, a prediction - most recently heralded as Mark Zuckerberg’s “metaverse”. 

>Faced as we are with the (purported) impending takeover of real space by virtual space. 

To summarise, avatars are integral to any virtual experience. There is no interaction in a virtual space without these entities, but in ontological terms, they are so much more than hollow representations in the placelessness of virtual space. As user-curated projections, they can embody and indeed manifest concepts of the self, as both a qualitatively fixed and unmediated temporal-spatial object within the informational circuits of the hyper-virtu-real. Yes, anachronistically, the movements of man automate its virtual other, and this is still the case, but this is a transgressive summary of the avatar. In every example above, the avatar self is transcendental - for we are constructed as it is constructed. The feedback loop, whichever way it works and however you enter it, explores, outlines, remakes and shifts the self, marking it as elementally hybridised - an eliding of (once) distinct forms. 

------------ 

 

This piece opened up some distinct avenues of thought. Theatre is, as a dramatic medium, one that ‘looks back’, a visceral and at times shocking feedback loop, an experience not possible in cinema, which is less existential – in the sense that cinema involves a present audience, whereas in theatre, both audience, stage, cast and crew are present. The medium itself is present, not solely its image-repertoire (Barthes) or mechanisms of display. This ‘looking back’ has the effect of reifying the audience as an extension of the show itself, where typically the reverse is true in other mediums. 

I began thinking of virtual characters as two embodied forms: first as roundly actualised, whether that be as projections or experimental, experiential agents for accessing and interacting with the virtual, but also in a second way, which is more remote but no less impactful: as the non-playable avatar (NPA), itself an informatic container whose presence – whether as AI or scripted bot - is integral to the design and success of any world design-content (narrative, lore, politics, as well as a broad spectrum of demographies). By the latter, I definitely do not mean other directly playable avatars in a given virtual space, as these would fall within the scope of the first category. Without the latter (second) category, any playable character avatar could be classed as a solipsistic vehicle for experiencing a virtual environment when the complexity of any game environment is always enriched by NPAs. 

The below article concerns the above phenomenon, but I also found a thread on a subreddit called r/patientgamers about loneliness in games. The thread is largely split between those that enjoy experiencing a game world for the sense of “isolation” and “immersion” that that provides, while others feel bereft in a world without “banter” and “companionship”. One such poster (ChuckChuckChuck_) comments: 

> Finally someone like me! I can barely play games at night when my wife goes to sleep. If she stays up reading a book in living room with me or whatever, I can play anything, even Dark Souls. As soon as I’m alone, I can barely play anything. 

I myself recently completed Naughty Dog’s the Last of Us 2, a game which I thoroughly enjoyed for how gritty, experimental and immersive its world and its story are, but the moments shared in the game – where as Ellie or Abbie you embark on a dual mission, alongside an NPC ‘friend’ - felt lighter, less at odds with the depressive, post-apocalyptic, dystopian America depicted in the game, where savage gangs and zombies threaten your ‘existence’ at every turn. I absolutely felt less lonely in these phases of the game. At times, the thought of completing another harrowing, breathless solo mission in the depths of some overrun hospital or office block, without so much as a (virtual) window of framed sunlight for company, literally filled me with dread. 

Another poster (TheJoshider10) espouses a similar sentiment in relation to Thatgamecompany and Santa Monica Studios’ Journey (2012): 

> It depends on the game. I think Journey is a perfect example of how the feeling of isolation and loneliness that elevate the game because it's calming on its own but then when you stumble upon another player you feel this overwhelming sense of joy and companionship because of how isolated and calming it was on your own.

Burgess, J. Jones, C. (2020) “I Harbour Strong Feelings for Tali Despite Her Being a Fictional Character”: Investigating Videogame Players’ Emotional Attachments to Non-Player Characters. Vol. 20, issue 1. ISSN:1604-7982 

I alluded to the above article in the last passage. As a piece, it struck me just how invested certain players can become with NPCs – and the caveat here is of course that not *all* players experience such strong feelings – yet it is nonetheless intriguing that many players do harbour just as strong, if not stronger feelings for non-playable characters. The authors set out to analyse and decode players reactions to two of Mass Effect’s (Bioware, 2007-2012) NPCs, namely Tali and Garrus, who are both respectively alien creatures, rich in subtext and lore that grows throughout the game’s initial anthology (three standalone titles spanning a five-year release cycle). The emotional attachments that people experience and express (through dedicated online fan forums) are referred to as being “intense.” Interestingly, they arrive at the following conclusion: 

> [T]he emotional attachment for the female character of Tali was expressed from the players’ point of view, while the emotional attachment for the male character of Garrus was expressed from the player character of Shepard’s point of view. 

Both characters have an assigned sex and depending on the sex of Shepherd (as chosen by the player on beginning their campaign at the outset), the game’s sole playable character, can enter into an amorous relationship with either one of the aforementioned NPCs. 

This effect has been notified in other correlational studies, where the intensity of player’s attachment to certain playable characters bordered on identification, here termed to mean “how audiences lose awareness of themselves and imagine their sense of self as a character.” 

> Furthermore, it was found that players experienced a ‘bleed effect’ similar to that of non-computerised role play, and players shared emotions with their PC (playable character) similar to that of identification. 

This is of course in direct contrast to the findings of Hart’s (2017) paper on personality projection, where the likelihood of such an outcome, namely the avatar as a vehicle for self-projection, is posited but not instantiated by their data. Any whom, the relationship that a player can experience with a virtual playable character *or* NPC is characterised by Bopp et al., (2019) in the following definition: 

> [The] “sense of liking, connection and closeness a player feels to any in-game character.” 

Latterly, the analysis of a range of forum users comments in relation to both Tali and Garrus are characterised by a range of qualitative methodologies across two forum ‘versions,’ after original (V1) Tali and Garrus threads were locked (and never reopened) by moderators before threads with very similar themes later came into existence (V2). 

>[O]ne player noted: “I love Tali”, and agreed with another who said she was: “[...] a character that you can actually fall in love with” (Tali V2, Player Feelings). Another stated: “[...] the attraction to Tali has far, far more to do with her character (intelligent, sweet, shy, quirky, selfless, courageous, honest)” 

> The comments posted about Tali’s character suggest that players developed strong, emotional attachments to her based on what they perceived was her personality. 

Here, the authors cite the ‘bleed effect’ referred to earlier (Waern, 2015) when framing their interpretation of player comments exhibiting the “intensity of emotional attachments”: 

> Interestingly, when players were commentating on their love for Tali, the comments were all written from their viewpoint, not that of their PC, the character of Shepard. Players discussed their emotional attachments to Tali, not how they perceived their PC of Shepard and Tali felt about each other. 

This is also, it is stated, indicative of the notion that characters (playable or otherwise) who enter into amorous or romantic relations “supports Mallon and Lynch’s (2014) findings that characters, who can be the focus of a romantic relationship, are greatly appreciated by players.” Various users/commenters evidently feel an intense sense of connection with both characters, but ascribing notions of personality, even individualism, to a virtual non-playable character demonstrates either a bleed effect or that we, as humans, are able to transfer our personhood, extend our subjectivity and its complex inter-relational web of lived emotional, empathic concepts, to not only actual entities (other humans, animals) but affectational entities. 

> The comments posted about Tali’s character suggest that players developed strong, emotional attachments to her based on what they perceived was her personality. 

Just as interesting were the observed ‘attachment motivated behaviours’ where users, motivated by these emotional attachments for both NPCs, “explored topics they felt were important to them.” The forum users took time to discuss important racial (species), political and tactical aspects of their characters world’s and histories, outside their (the NPC) in game skill or abilities. Likewise, a number of players modified their playable characters to acknowledge their kinship or closeness with either Garrus or Tali. 

> Several of the discussions about Tali and Garrus also revolved around how players’ emotional attachments for them affected how they used the game mechanics in Mass Effect 2 (BioWare, 2010), for example player customisation. One poster asked: “Anyone else here colored Shepard's armor to match Garrus?” (Garrus V1, Game Manipulation) and received several posts in agreement. 

It is a fascinating study which evidences the rapport between player, playable character and non-playable character. It underlines, bolds and highlights the yawning platitude that “we can have feelings for a virtual other” yet the authors themselves state that the Bopp et al. definition of the relationship that one can develop with an in-game character cannot, arguably, account for such “powerful” attachments as those evidenced in this study. Our subjectivity and personhood are clearly not distinct entities; our identity, through maybe any networked modality, can extend (even travel) to, occupy even, “hollow” (Stellarc) forms; though maybe there is a semantic misstep there. 

Alan Watts is quoted to have said, “Life is the universe experiencing itself, in endless variety.” Do we as humans, when we see or understand the signs of life, *create* life?

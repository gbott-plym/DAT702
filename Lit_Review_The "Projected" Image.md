The theme of the projected image, of light’s interaction with a surface to create a projected picture, is explored variously in the three texts (quotes from) detailed here. Curiously, or semantically at least, there is much in the way of overlap in what I have sourced – on the whole, the projected image is presented as being something "perfect,” but also “transparent” (Baudrillard); as having the qualities of “verisimilitude” and “repertoire” (Barthes 1986); whereas McLuhan offers us the image as “transient” and providing “contour”. 

> Well, with the hologram, as with the clone, it is {…) the end  of  illusion, the stage, the secret through  the materialized projection of all available information on  the subject, through materialized transparency. (Baudrillard)< 

“All available information” ties in very neatly with Barthes term, the “image-repertoire” - where within the boundaries of an image, all available or companion qualities for it to have achieved its fullest or most “pregnant” (Barthes) realisation of itself are present. “Perfect image and end of the imaginary,” states Baudrillard. What a thought?! A thing of such purity, of such indelibility as to eviscerate the "lure” (Barthes) of imagination. Render it impotent. As imagination requires space, even the tiniest of fissures, to operate within. 

Barthes also analogises the idea of being “glued” to the projected image, which as a verb has been imbibed across cultures; I could not count the number of times I have been described as “glued” to a monitor or screen. Though within Barthes, 

>[T]he image captivates me, captures me: I am *glued* to the representation, and it is this glue that establishes the *naturalness* (the psedo-nature) of the filmed scene […] the image alone (the image-repertoire) is *close*, though the image is “true” (can produce the resonance of truth).< 

This speaks almost to the idea of the projected image as requiring overwhelming scale – or optical parity - in order to fully immerse the viewer. The totality of the scene must fill one's vision in order for the spectator to ‘lose’ oneself in it; to give our sensible faculties over to its sheer scale, which might at that point be comparable to the effects of the human eye. Spatial distance as a key factor is arguably a little limiting; I find screens, while not able to wholly obscure their surrounds, have a focal quality that is intensely narrowing. They can become, however small or large, the only thing in a room, in no small part due to that “glueyness”. Our subjectivity in such instances is completely subordinated, the territory between mind-eye-screen infinitessimal. 

>For such is the narrow range – at least for me – in which can function the fascination of film, the cinematographic hypnosis: I must be in the story (there must be verisimilitude), but I must also be *elsewhere*< 

The holy trinity of projector, light beam and projected image is inverted somewhat in the assertion that the ‘real’ medium is not necessarily the image itself, but feasibly could be the projector or the light.  

>The hologram, perfect  image and  end  of  the imaginary.  Or rather, it  is  no  longer  an image at all  -  the real  medium is the laser, concentrated  light, quintessentialized,  which is  no longer  a visible or reflexive  light,  but an abstract light  of  simulation. Laser/scalpel.< 

Light as an abstracted form, given shape as a conical “imperious jet [brushing] our heads” (Barthes) and even as a “scalpel” (Baudrillard). The physicality of the beam, of its magnificence within the darkened void of a hall or theatre, resplendent in its gossamer materiality. The comingling of the present and physical - “glancing off hair” - with the abstracted force of the “laser”. Interesting here that both Baudrillard and Barthes eulogize light emanating from a projector as having such force – the force of meaning, of symbolism, of the “materiality” (Baudrillard) of their play, of their ability to enrapture and “hypnotise” (Barthes). The latter being a qualitative prerequisite of the simulation and its engagement with us. Of sitting and staring at screens, we all do it, switching from one to the next like moths – is it the light that attracts us, or is it the content? Or a bit of both? 

For McLuhan, the “medium is the message”. Light, for example, is one of the truest mediums of information conveyance as without it, there can be no derived content. Electricity, and its immediate efficacy, renders technology as “extensions of man” - extensions of ourselves, which coalesce with our senses in a “mosiac” tapestry of sensory, “synesthetic” experience. 

>the TV camera provides, not the isolated  moment or aspect, but the contour, the iconic profile and the transparency.< 

The camera as an extension of the eye, a photograph as the embodiment of a memory, or the gestalt moment. The elapse of images in a projected image sequence renders the sensory impressions defined as a memory or the eyes’ capture of the moment in their truest depiction however, as something that is again transient, fleeting, gossamer; “creating a world of accelerated transience” (McLuhan) though still physical: “the end of the imaginary” (Baudrillard). 

>Indeed, the world of the movie that was prepared by the photograph has become synonymous with illusion and fantasy [...which] substitutes a “reel” world for fantasy.< 

Or simulation. The reel as real. The translation of photography to the movie experience is said to have given gesture to the stillness or “contour” of the photographic image. Though it does make you wonder, when considering the mechanics of the eye and our ability to perceive only a given frame rate (24 fps), of all the information, impressions lost in those ‘in-between moments’. The ”mime and dance” of the photograph is also analogous to Barthes description of the conical shaft of light itself, commingling with the atmosphere of the theatre. Observed in sequence, there is no blurring of the moving subject, though when freeze-framed, we see the subject as something gestural, more abstracted, its contours disintegrated by the mechanised ‘pause’. 

After the creation of the photograph, art is said to have moved away from ‘realism’, towards impression, neofigurativism and abstraction. The need for the subject or object to be identifiable as itself requires is no longer the preeminent focus of art. 

>Instead of depicting a world that matched the world we already knew, the artists turned to presenting the creative process for public participation.< 

>[The] image so formed [that of the TV image] has the quality of sculpture and icon, rather than of picture.< 

This idea of public participation of/in the image, as helping to sculpt it and/or imbue it with content or context, is something I can already feel as being extremely important to my work-in-progress practical aims. Taken literally, this could involve actual participation within a creative process, such as performance, or via technology, or as an extension of our subjectivity also. Though the medium as the message in this regard is only partially true; or moreover it would be true for some, less so for others - for those that declined to participate in the same strict sense, whose interpretation of such experiences would be extended by their refusal to engage with a given phenomenon as “live” and requiring “action”. The medium as such – can it involve passive as well as active participation, or are these different forms of engagement exclusive? The distinction between embodiment (action) and observation (passive) could be a key question. 

>The TV image requires each instant that we "close" the spaces in the mesh by a convulsive sensuous participation that is profoundly kinetic and tactile, because tactility is the interplay of the senses, rather than the isolated contact of skin and object. < 

Can active engagement with a medium attain the truest outcomes when “[a]ll media exist to invest our lives with artificial perception and arbitrary values”? Do we misinterpret the utility of a toothbrush when we buy a specific brand, or design? When we participate in a virtual or simulated realm, do we misinterpret the game or objective (the software aim) of putting the hardware on, when really the extension of our subjectivity is the real aim?

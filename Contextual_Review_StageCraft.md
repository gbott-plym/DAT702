# Stagecraft – simulation 

## The use of simulation in contemporary media practice 

 
While working on the *The Mandalorian*, Lucasfilm and series creator Jon Favreau pioneered a new use of Unreal Engine’s (UE) rendering capabilities, displaying virtual sets on a panoptic LCD display, which affectionately became known as ‘the Volume’. As the Volume is itself a vast screen, using sophisticated parallax and frustum methods enabled the actors to engage with a virtual, projected set, while the light it emits removes the need for typical and exhaustive post-production techniques, such as keying, compositing and recolouring when using green screen, as well as the need for HDRs. Virtual sets can also be adapted, sculpted and textured on the fly, using UE’s landscape creation tools and content browser.

I was reminded, when researching the Volume, of a recent Ewan McGregor interview in the Hollwood Reporter (Abramovitch 2021), wherein he discussed the tech in line with his own acting experiences, as well as citing the challenges of working on green or blue screen sets. 

>George [Lucas] loves technology and loves pushing into the realm. He wanted more and more control over what we see in the background. […] After three or four months of that, it just gets really tedious – especially when the scenes are... I don't want to be rude, but it's not Shakespeare. There's not something to dig into the dialogue that can satisfy you when there's no environment there. It was quite hard to do."< 

And on the volume specifically: 

> [T]hey project [the virtual backgrounds] onto this massive LED screen. So if you’re in a desert, you’re standing in the middle of a desert. If you’re in the snow, you’re surrounded by snow. And if you’re in a cockpit of a starfighter, you’re in space. It’s going to feel so much more real.<

It seems almost too obvious, the idea that a performer, however exceptional their imagination or acting prowess, would grow tired of working on sets without any environment context – with only outlying, placeholder shapes as set dressing, rendered in monochrome, and their fellow actors to exchange with; and in some circumstances not even that, where certain characters are virtually rendered. I’m reminded of this quote from Stanislavski’s *An Actor Prepares*, 

> >There is no such thing as actuality on the stage< 

Yet there needs to be a semblance of the representational - in the mind’s eye, or that of the eye itself – as without it our subjectivity can founder. When McGregor uses the term ‘real’ it’s clear that this is the vernacular of the hyperreal, where an alien landscape, rendered natively to occupy every corner of one’s vision, could conceivably be defined as ‘real’ even tangentially - this is pure simulation. Though again I am reminded of Baudrillard: 

>No more mirror of being and appearances, of the real and its concept. […] It [the simulation] no longer needs to be rational, because it no longer measures itself against either an ideal or negative instance. It is no longer anything but operational.< 

If we as rational beings no longer need to be thus, or can no longer be thus, what is left? There is this interesting idea of the actor, a contributor to the production, as someone on the other side of the ‘veil’, but also as someone who has watched the films – is their subjectivity, their recollection of events changed by the conflation of having both starred in and watched the films? How do memory, perception, time change these modalities of experience/engagement? To state categorically that it was a trying time, working without simulated backgrounds; that it did not “feel […] real”. And when talking about the Volume, “you’re” stood in the desert. “You’re” stood in the snow. Fighting a Sith lord in a cavernous, erupting volcano. Replacing the signs of the real with the hyperreal. Establishing that indexical link. Joining up the imagination with its virtually embodied signs. McGregor is rejecting the banality of Lucas' methods and choosing to view his subjectivity as being allied to the virtual representation. He chooses the simulation – the hyperreal – over the vicissitudes of green screen and drudgery of imagination, always imagination. 

A similar technique to that of StageCraft was used on this unnamed production also, *link*:

In this production, vast LED wall-screens are set up to preview recorded, wrap around footage of the countryside while filming inside the train carriage itself. 

------------------------------------------------------ 

I was discussing with a friend not so long ago the premise of simulation, of the mechanics of the hyperreal. What would happen if, say, you were unknowingly drugged after embarking on a train journey. Once drugged, you fall asleep peacefully. You are then moved to a studio, with a train ‘set’ - a mechanised replica, which has all the fixtures and fittings of a typical train carriage, as well as fellow passengers, a ticket inspector, etc. Outside your window, you watch as the train paces through the countryside, feeling it arc as it slopes around the gentle camber of the tracks, rattling as its wheels pound the uneven rails. The verisimilitude of these impressions is holistically ‘true to life’. 

And yet, the train is a mechanised prop. The world outside the windows is 16k seamless footage of a landscape, indistinguishable from the ‘real’ thing, projected onto a wraparound LCD screen. Your fellow passengers are paid actors, extras, who affect the banality, the mundanity of such experiences with practiced veracity. 

Watching this scene, a person, the director, sits in the darkened confines of the studio in a collapsible chair, out of sight, enraptured by the simulation they have constructed. At some point it will end, due to the temporality of the ruse. And yet, the director is able to watch the naturalistic play of the passenger, who sits unalarmed, unassuming, unaffected. 

In this example, where both passenger and director are observers of the simulation (one as subject, one as object), whose perception of events is any less simulated, whether real or imagined? Do both the states of ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’ not have to exist to qualify the other?

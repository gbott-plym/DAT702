>We’ve always been augmented by our instruments, our technologies. Technology is what constructs our humanity; the trajectory of technology is what has propelled human developments.< 

One of the keenest observations of this idea exists in the dichotomy of real/virtual. To over-focus on virtual or real as states that are independently vying for control marginalises the importance of the tool which bridges the chasm between the two. Without the tech, the movement from real>virtual is always out of reach, and by extension vice versa. 

>But what’s interesting for me is not simply going more and more virtual but rather exploring the interface between the actual and the virtual. I’m trying to investigate whether a physical body can function in a virtual immersive environment and whether an intelligent avatar might be able to perform in the real world by possessing a physical body.< 

>A hollow body is a host body.< 

This is the perfect analogy for interpreting virtual objects – do we confer onto them a ‘hollowness’ because of their absence/distinction from real-world objects? The virtual space, much like the gallery space, is a prime location for siting information, a thing which in itself (informatics) can bridge the contradistinction between virtual as hollow (absence) and physical as pregnant (presence), because it is transformative. The relay of information, however it is experienced, involves exchange. Our tools exist to embody that information (Snelting’s wooden spoon) - they are not distinct from it. In short, there is neither; the virtual space cannot exist without its Other, the physical space, the physical mind-body, latterly referred to as the obsolete body. Likewise, the virtual space cannot shed itself of the physical mind-body that accesses it. Harraway acknowledges the potentiality for tourism inherent in this dialectic, an interesting sub-discussion. Virtual tourism of spaces (simulated) real and imagined, or tourism of the self – where the identity of the traveller is plastic, contrived (true, pseudo or anonymised). 

>You don’t escape the body; you function differently with the interfaces that produce these immersive and interactive effects. You construct an extended operational system that functions beyond the biology of the body and beyond the local space it inhabits.< 

>What we’re really constructing are more and more feedback loops between the body and other bodies and its environment, whether technological, cultural, social or whatever, and this makes for a much more interesting extended operational system.< 

>But I suspect we make very different metaphysical assumptions on what we mean by the obsolete body. The body is obsolete in form and function. But we cannot operate disembodied. We cannot discard the body.< 

Obsolete in the sense that the body’s functionality, operability is central to this genesis of augmentation. The body is the foundation upon which other tools and interfaces are grafted. Analogously, the body could be seen as the motherboard. 

Is there an incision – a bisection – that intersects the virtual and physical bodies when our subjectivity is extended? No. Stellarc goes on to use the word ‘extruded’. So much cross over between Stellarc and Harraway. Rejection of the “Cartesian split” - the individuation of the real and virtual physical states as extended, projected, not detached or distinct. 

>not so much a split self from a body but rather a self that is extruded.< 

The below quote tentatively links to a working idea I had of projected avatar control, whereby an agent can do one of two things: 1) simulate their own movement with that of a controller (game device), or determine their own physical movement as joined to that of an extended avatar – controller and agent make the same movement, which are projected elsewhere (e.g. virtually). 

>What happens when half of your body is being remotely prompted by a person in another place?< 

Stellarc’s projects are exciting for this idea of embodiment as problematised when augmented by technology. How is our agency, our subjectivity, our materiality changed by these extensions? 

 

## Ed Atkins - *Ribbons*

Stellarc’s work – PROSTHETIC HEAD – reminded me of Ed Atkin’s *Ribbons*, a show which sought to subvert “the conventions of moving image and literature.” This was achieved with high-def CG, interspersed with musical signifiers and juxtapositions of text, a combination which is always ambiguous and ambivalent, problematic, such are the contrasting modalities of interlaced meaning/unmeaning. 

The work is less driven by thoughts as to how technology problematises what it means to be human, its more an examination of how sophisticated media and language signifiers (text, music), can subvert traditional models of semiosis.

This text is a collection of essays which seek to provide an epistemological basis for defining humanity as ‘posthuman’ - as a species marked and changed by our interactions with technology and informatics. This is not an attempt at outlining “fantasies” that entertain the mind as something distinct from body, quite the opposite, in fact: mind (consciousness) is considered to be embedded in and constituted by the materiality of the brain and its many inputs. Hayles, in *Toward Embodied Virtuality*, proposes four assumptions upon which the posthuman subject can be characterised: 

> First, the posthuman view privileges informational pattern over material instantiation, so that embodiment in a biological substrate is seen as an accident of history rather than an inevitability of life.  

>Second, the posthuman view considers consciousness, regarded as the seat of human identity in the Western tradition long before Descartes thought he was a mind thinking, as an epiphenomenon, as an evolutionary upstart trying to claim that it is the whole show when in actuality it is only a minor sideshow. 

>Third, the posthuman view thinks of the body as the original prosthesis we all learn to manipulate, so that extending or replacing the body with other prostheses becomes a continuation of a process that began before we were born. 

>Fourth, and most important, by these and other means, the posthuman view configures human being so that it can be seamlessly articulated with intelligent machines. 

A key aim of Hayles is provide the logical groundwork to indisputably embody information; she is consistently perplexed by how – throughout history and indeed Western philosophy – the materiality of form, of bodies, is cleaved – or made distinct – from consciousness. The seat of thought is the mind, yet when we control the movement of our hand with the mind – and by extension thought – we do not disembody any of those processes, nor do we assume that the arm is moving itself. There is a lot of exposition as to the similarities between computational data and the conscious mind also.  

>When information loses its body, equating humans and computers is especially easy, for the materiality in which the thinking mind is instantiated appears incidental to its essential nature. 

But give data its body, that creates a whole new line of questioning. If it can be reasonably argued that the thoughts and impressions aroused by the variety of data we imbibe generate modalities of neurological engagement, could a computer not to be said to do the same with its own data? If a sensor of heat can register a range of temperatures and pronounce these conditions correctly, hot through cold, with or without the ‘I feel’, is that information abstract in relation to its device and design – to its teleology? 

She goes on to state that “it can be a shock to remember that for information to exist, it must always be instantiated in a medium”. 

When we separate thought from matter, data from device, we have attempted an “imaginary act” that predicates a naïve duality. 

>The point is not only that abstracting information from a material base is an imaginary act but also, and more fundamentally, that conceiving of information as a thing separate from the medium instantiating it is a prior imaginary act that constructs a holistic phenomenon as an information/matter duality. 

Is information then not a question of perception? Where zeros and ones dance to produce signified forms, are those forms then detached from those zeros and ones and the hardware they are computed by, and detached again once we have interpreted them as symbolic? 

The mind and its processes, both internal, which govern the prosthesis of the body, and external, which extend the capacities of man into evolving dimensions of experience and knowledge, through the use of tools and the information they instantiate, are considered to be “agents” - of which consciousness is viewed as one of many. An agent no more ostensibly important than the one whose impulses tell us to search for food, or the agent that regulates breathing, or the agent that flips what we see of the world the right way up, and so on and on. 

Our holisitic agents utilise feedback loops to situate us within a given framework of perception, the foundation of which is the data borne of stimuli and their interpretation. This, as a reality, is not tethered to a given framework or substrate. These agents create a “heuristic” impression, a subjective impression of their environment and all the dynamic mitigating factors which that can incorporate, in a cycle of feedback that is constant – constant management. In other words, “feedback loops can flow not only within the subject but also between the subject and the environment.” This is logically extended to the process of simulation, or of perception as a posthuman and as a cyborg – as a subjectivity that is augmented by computerised bodies that assimilate with the networks of the human body. The mind extending the hardware of perception of the original prosthesis itself. 

> In the posthuman, there are no essential differences or absolute demarcations between bodily existence and computer simulation, cybernetic mechanism and biological organism, robot teleology and human goals. 

The below quote is very pertinent in relation to the early ideas I’ve been considering with regards practical outcomes. 

>The objectivist view sees information flowing from the system to the observers, but feedback can also loop through the observers, drawing them in to become part of the system being observed.” 

This would have been written well before the advent of the smart phone/device, but it foregrounds the relationship we now share with a smart speaker for example, or social media app. The smart speaker (or Siri functionality) exists to dislocate the end-user from any interaction with hardware, but heighten usage through omniscience. Not disembody. Its wirelessness (as voice activated) is the feedback loop made manifest, dematerialising the user and hardware as entities that require tactile interrelations. Or orders of engagement: locate > unlock > hold and use; lock > dislocate. There is no true dislocation possible in the permissive wireless relationship, only pauses – pauses without distance. Space in this way (wireless space, which is reasonably all space) is reduced to the finest possible distance, arguably the same level as with permanent prostheses, such as affixed artifical limbs, pacemakers, hearing aids, etc. The distance between the self and tech as zero – though whether there was a greater distance prior to wireless teleologies is debatable. 

Social media is likewise a thing that involves you in a loop. It’s triggers, pings, vibrations are all measures of that loop as a manifest epiphenomenon – secondary to the post or message having been sent, though the space between ‘posted’ and ‘received’ are, due to the speed at which data is shared, almost indivisible. These receipt triggers heighten this idea of oneness with tech, of its assimilation with its corporeal agent even if these notifications are actioned in no way. The loop does not require secondary action – the act of reading or reacting to – only the reality of the loop and its properties of obfuscation to survive.  Though survival is the wrong word. The enmeshing of sociality through a device that is melded to the web of a now permanently networked hyperspace, like a spider reacting to the finest of movements in its web. There is an idea I find fascinating in Turkle’s *Alone Together*, where she refers to the testimony of several teens as being so in tune with their phones that they “know” when their phone is vibrating “even when it has been banished to their school locker”. Not because they can feel in their separation the moment when a phone is activated by a notification – which I suppose could be possible, if highly unlikely – but because of the habitual pulsing of that device as a kinetic accompaniment to their psyche, if you will. The phone’s absence removes that sensation and thus creates a dislocation, a phantom sense – but here then the senses cannot be interpreted as individual, as one of touch, taste, auditory etc. These extensions, as tech, are a synthesiser. I’m sure there is a thought in McLuhan to that effect. 

>This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium-- that is, of any extension of ourselves -- result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology. 

> With instant speed the causes of things began to emerge to awareness again, 

Here, the medium is social media, its device the smart phone – the device being the facet that is an addition to ourselves, and thus we are extended: the result of the new scale merging with our awareness. Also this: 

> [O]f handling and sensing many facets at a time through more than one sense at a time. 

To return to the above Hayles quote, where she rejects, or re-sites, the “objectivist view” of information “drawing observers in to become part of the system being observed” is important because of the reaching subjectivity that exists between tech and self, audience and actor. Grotowski states that the actor and spectator must “undertake a similar process of self-penetration" - that dually they must annihilate the bodies they are in in order to find a mutual, cohabited space of discernment, shedding the “everyday mask” – which is surely the destruction of a kind of space, of disconnection, of criticality, of individuated subjectivity. “The Suspension of Disbelief” even - Aristotle? 

Does tech do this too? Does it annihilate the body?
